-- 1. Return ALL the data in the 'movies' table.

-- 4. Return ONLY your name from the 'people' table.

-- 5. The cinema is showing 'Batman Begins', but Batman is DC, not Marvel! Delete the entry from the 'movies' table.

DELETE FROM movies WHERE id = 9;

-- DELETE 1

INSERT INTO people (name) VALUES ('Zsolt Podoba-Szalai');

INSERT INTO movies (title, year, show_time) VALUES ('Guardians of the Galaxy 2', 2017, '00:00');

-- 9. The cinema would also like to make the Guardian movies a back to back feature. Update the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' show time from 17:55 to 21:30

UPDATE movies SET show_time = '21:30' WHERE title = 'Guardians of the Galaxy' AND show_time = '17:55';

-- UPDATE 1

-- ## Extension
--
-- 1. Research how to delete multiple entries from your table in a single command.

DELETE FROM table WHERE table_column_name IN (entry1, entry2, entry3)

DELETE FROM table WHERE table_column_name BETWEEN (bottom_value, top_value)

DELETE FROM table WHERE table_column_name >= a_value AND table_column_name <= another_value
-- CARE: the column must be the same in both cases for this method.
